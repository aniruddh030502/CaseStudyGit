This is a Snake and Ladder game built in [programming language used, e.g., Python, Java, etc.]. It's a simple, yet fun, board game where players take turns to roll a dice, move their token forward, and encounter snakes and ladders on their journey to the finish line.

The game follows the classic rules of Snakes and Ladders with a single player or multiplayer mode. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach or pass the last square on the board.
